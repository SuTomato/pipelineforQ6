# pipelineforQ6
This is an example of  bioinformatic pipeline for identify polymorphisms. 
Sample example is from PRJNA230524 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//bioproject/PRJNA230524).
I use the data from SRX404550 as an example (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX404550[accn]). 

Update: the reference genome used in the pipeline was not correct, so the data was not generated properly. 
The SRR data is the DNA sequence of methylation sites. The reference genome data is the DNA sequence of the whole genome.
