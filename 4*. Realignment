## Download GATK
git clone https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk.git
# Misisng file for building 
wget https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/master/testsettings.gradle
./gradlew bundle
# The downloaded file was not in the right format
# Code was manually copy and pasted from github, and finally worked 
export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/gatk

# Create realignment target
java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -T RealignerTargetCreator -R S_lycopersicum_chromosomes.4.00.fa -I dedup_arcanum.bam -o realignment_targets.list 
# No GenomeAnalysisTK.jar file
gatk RealignerTargetCreator -R S_lycopersicum_chromosomes.4.00.fa -I dedup_arcanum.bam -o realignment_targets.list
gatk --java-options "-Xmx4G" RealignerTargetCreator -R S_lycopersicum_chromosomes.4.00.fa -I dedup_arcanum.bam -o realignment_targets.list
# The RealignerTargetCreator is no longer avaliable in gatk4

## I tried to (1) download gatk3 but haveing trouble building the files: wget https://github.com/broadgsa/gatk/archive/3.8-1.tar.gz
## (2) looking for gatk4 codes, skip this step
